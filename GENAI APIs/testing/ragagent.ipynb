      "1. **Low-Impact Aerobic Exercises**: These are generally safe and effective for people with liver disease. Examples include:\n",
      "   - Brisk walking\n",
      "   - Cycling (stationary or outdoors)\n",
      "   - Swimming\n",
      "   - Water aerobics\n",

      "2. **Strength Training**: Exercises that strengthen the muscles around the joints can help with weight management and overall health. Focus on exercises that do not involve heavy weights or high-impact movements. Examples include:\n",
      "   - Bodyweight exercises (e.g., squats, lunges, push-ups)\n",
      "   - Resistance band exercises\n",
      "   - Light dumbbell exercises\n",

      "3. **Flexibility and Balance Exercises**: These can help prevent falls and improve overall mobility. Examples include:\n",

      "   - Stretching exercises\n",

      "   - Jumping\n",
      "   - High-impact aerobics\n",

      "   - Stay hydrated during and after exercise.\n",
      "   - Monitor blood sugar levels before, during, and after exercise.\n",
